# ALgorithms ( set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.)
Algorithms Specializations
 #divide and conquer
 A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type,
 until these become simple enough to be solved directly. 
 The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem
 
 #Searchng and sorting
 Searching Algorithms are designed to retrieve an element from any data structure where it is used. 
 A Sorting Algorithm is used to arranging the data of list or array into some specific order. 
 These algorithms are generally classified into two categories i.e. Sequential Search and Interval Search
